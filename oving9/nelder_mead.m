function [x, fval, x_iter] =  nelder_mead(x0, outp)
%NELDER_MEAD Unconstrainded optimization with the Nelded-Mead method
%   [X,FVAL,X_ITER] = NELDER_MEAD(X0, OUTP) attempts to solve the 
%   unconstrained nonlinear optimization problem
%        
%                              min f(x)    
%                               x
%   
%   The initial set of points (the initial simplex) contains X0 and
%   nearby points. The proximity of the nearby points is set with the
%   parameter perturb_param. Upon successful termination, X is the best
%   point found, and FVAL the objective function value at this point.
%   X_ITER contains the best point x at every iteration. If outp is passed
%   as 'report', the function prints a detailed report at every iteration.
%   If report is passed as [], no report is printed.
%
%   The function prints a report and plots f(x) as a function of the best x
%   at iteration k. The objective function is specified in the subfunction
%   function fvals = f(x); note that the function accepts a matrix x, whose
%   columns are points, and returns the function value at all these points
%   in a row vector. This file implements f(x) as the Rosenbrock function,
%   but the subfunction may of course be modified to implement other
%   functions.
%   
%   NOTE: This function is written for educational purposes only. The
%         algorithm is neither quick nor robust, and should only be used on
%         very small problems. The implementation is meant to illustrate
%         Procedure 9.5 in Nocedal and Wright: Numerical Optimization,
%         2nd ed., Springer, 2006. There are probably some errors in the
%         implementation, please report any to heirung@itk.ntnu.no. See
%         fminsearch.m for a much better (although more complicated) 
%         implementation of the Nelded-Mead algorithm.
